## What is react-recycled-list?

react-recycled-list is a library for rendering large list with expensive components. Like [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) and [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized), react-recycled-list only renders the rows that are visible to the user to improve performance. However react-recycled-list differs in that it keeps the DOM node count constant, meaning it **does not ummount** your row component when it is scrolled out of the visible window. This results in much better performance compared to traditional windowing libraries.

## Install

```bash
npm install react-recycled-list
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-recycled-list
```
